# Running Collatz Conjecture UI from Command Line

This Java application displays the Collatz Conjecture cycle for numbers up to a specified maximum (`n(i)`) using a command line interface (CLI).

## Prerequisites:
- Java Development Kit (JDK) 8 or later installed on your machine.
- Access to a command line interface (CLI) such as Terminal (Mac/Linux) or Command Prompt (Windows).

## Setup Instructions:
1. Navigate to the project directory.
2. Compile the Java source code: `javac Main.java`
3. Run the compiled Java application: `java main`

## Using the Application:
- Upon running the application, a window titled "Collatz Conjecture" will appear.
- Enter the maximum number of iterations (n(i)) you want to display in the provided text field.
- Click the "Generate" button to generate and display the Collatz Conjecture cycles in the table.

## Example Usage:
- Suppose you want to see the Collatz Conjecture cycles for numbers up to 100:
  1. Enter 100 in the Max n(i): text field.
  2. Click Generate.
  3. The application will display the cycles in the table.

## Notes:
- Ensure you have sufficient memory allocated for running Java applications, especially if displaying a large number of iterations.
- The application utilizes Swing for the graphical user interface. It's designed to be simple and straightforward to use.
